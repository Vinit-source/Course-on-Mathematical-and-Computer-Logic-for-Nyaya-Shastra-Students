### Predicate Logic & Quantifiers
1. **Express in predicate logic:** "All students in the class have submitted their assignments."
2. **Express in predicate logic:** "There exists a student who has not submitted the assignment."
3. **Translate into a formal expression:** "If a number is prime, then it is not divisible by any other number except 1 and itself."
4. **Given:** $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$. **Prove:** $\exists x \, \neg Q(x) \rightarrow \exists x \, \neg P(x)$ using quantifier rules.
5. **State the negation of:** $\forall x \, \exists y \, (R(x, y) \wedge S(y))$.
6. **Express and prove using formal logic:** "If every student likes mathematics, then there exists at least one student who likes logic."
7. **Rewrite with quantifiers:** "Not every student has passed the exam."
8. **Given:** $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow R(x))$ and $\exists x P(x)$. **Prove:** $\exists x R(x)$.

### Inference Rules
9. **Prove using Modus Ponens:** Given: $p \rightarrow q$ and $p$. Conclude $q$.
10. **Prove using Modus Tollens:** Given: $p \rightarrow q$ and $\neg q$. Conclude $\neg p$.
11. **Apply De Morgan's Law:** Convert $\neg (P(x) \vee Q(x))$ into an equivalent expression.
12. **Use Universal Instantiation:** Given $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$, infer $P(c) \rightarrow Q(c)$ for a constant $c$.
13. **Using Contrapositive Rule:** Given $p \rightarrow q$, show that $\neg q \rightarrow \neg p$ is equivalent.
15. Given $\exists x , (P(x) \wedge R(x))$ and $\forall x \, (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))$, prove $\exists x \, (Q(x) \wedge R(x))$. 
17. **Use rules of inference** to show that if $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow (Q(x) \wedge S(x)))$ and $\forall x(P(x) \wedge R(x))$ are true, then $\forall x (R(x) \wedge S(x))$ is true.  
18. **Use rules of inference** to show that if $\forall x (P(x) ∨ Q(x))$ and $\forall x ((¬P(x) ∧ Q(x)) → R(x))$ are true, then $\forall x (¬R(x) → P(x))$ is also true, where the domains of all quantifiers are the same

### Proofs (Direct, Indirect, and Contradiction)
17. **Direct Proof:** Prove that if $n$ is an even integer, then $n^2$ is also even.
19. **Direct Proof:** Show that for all integers $n$, if $n$ is divisible by 4, then $n^2$ is also divisible by 16.
20. **Indirect Proof:** Prove that if the product of two integers is odd, then both integers must be odd.
21. **Proof by Contradiction:** Prove that there is no largest prime number.
    - Assume that there exists a largest prime number and derive a contradiction.
22. **Proof by Contradiction:** Assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational and derive a contradiction to conclude that it is irrational.
